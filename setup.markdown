## Who are you, and what do you do?

I am a programmer with close to 7 years of experience. I build websites & APIs with Ruby on Rails & ReactJS during my dayjob. During my spare time, I play around with different programming languages like [Haskell](https://github.com/tejasbubane/haskell-book-code), [Clojure](https://github.com/tejasbubane/brave-clojure-book-code), [Elixir](https://github.com/tejasbubane/the-little-schmer-in-elixir), [ML](https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-languages/), etc.


## What hardware do you use?

My primary computer is Macbook Pro 13 inch 2017 model. It is lightweight and easy to carry around. [The butterfly keys](https://thenextweb.com/plugged/2019/07/07/what-hell-apple-butterfly-keyboard-keys-design/) are not too good, especially because I was using [a cherry MX blue keyboard](https://www.amazon.in/TVS-Bharal-Gold-Keyboard-Black/dp/B07B75DVZS) before, but I am used to this since past few months. But I sure miss the travel and sweet clicks of the cherries.

I am not a heavy phone user - whatsapp & twitter are my primary apps. So I generally prefer mid-range android phones so I don't need to worry about damaging or losing it. I currently own a [Samsung M30](https://www.samsung.com/in/smartphones/galaxy-m30-m305f-3gb/SM-M305FMBEINS/) with 3GB RAM & Android 10.

Headphones are [Sennheiser CX 275 S](https://www.amazon.in/Sennheiser-CX-275-Universal-Headphone/dp/B008V6T1IW). I prefer in-ear since they are light & easy to carry around.

## And what software?

[Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) user since almost 8 years right from my college days - I am a huge fan. My emacs config is [here](https://github.com/tejasbubane/dotemacs).
Heavy user of [magit](https://magit.vc/) for all things git - this is hands-down `the best` git tool out there. I switched to [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/) as my primary browser after its [quantum release](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2017/11/14/introducing-firefox-quantum/) and never looked back. For window management I used [spectacle](https://www.spectacleapp.com/) for a long time, but recently found out it is not maintained anymore so switched to [rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com/). Terminal is [iTerm 2](https://www.iterm2.com/) with [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) using my [custom config](https://github.com/tejasbubane/dotfiles). For video calls I use [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) or [Skype](https://www.skype.com/en/).

## What would be your dream setup?

I find my current setup sufficient. My dream setup would be a nice 4k monitor with an ergonomic mechanical keyboard  like [ergodox](https://ergodox-ez.com/) or [atreus 2](https://atreus.technomancy.us/2).
