multiple versions of JSON serializers in a Rails application with ease.\n\nAside: Even though Rails has an inbuilt mechanism\nto serialize domain objects,\nActiveModel Serializers (AMS) is a\npopular library for decoupling the serialization logic from database layer. This post assumes usage of AMS.\nChange is the only constant in software development and it is the view or presentation layer\nthat changes the most. In case of API-only apps, JSON schema is the view.\nAssume we have resources like product and inventory with corresponding serializers.\nNow product info is also required in inventory details.\nUsing belongs_to association\nwould pick the main product serializer which would render the entire product details which we don't need.\nSo we create another serializer InventoryProductSerializer because adding some method with hand-rolled json is not a good practice - which is exactly why we use serializers in the first place.\nThen we also have delivery_order - which also needs product info but with slightly different fields.\nWe think of saving those precious bytes on the network by sending only required fields and not single more. So we religiously create DeliveryOrderProductSerializer.\nThis goes on and on...\n\nLets take a moment and see if we can reduce this. Ideally inventory-product serializer will be used **only** by inventory serializer.\nSo why not somehow put it inside InventorySerializer where it belongs?\nWe can conveniently take advantage of Ruby's constant lookup algorithm to do this:\n\n\nWhile looking up for any constant (here the class constant ProductSerializer), it is first looked up inside the serializer class itself.\nWe have one there and which gets used. The next lookup of outer global ProductSerializer in product_serializer.rb never happens in this case.\nThus we have achieved colocated concerns.

We can change the pool size via config/database.yml:\n\nWe use redis for variety of purposes like caching, queuing, pubsub, etc. But when it comes to connecting to redis, we don't have any inbuilt connection pool.\nSo generally we end up using just one direct connection, mostly via a configuration or application-level global variable.\n\nThanks to the ludicrous speed of redis, most queries return in milliseconds &amp; we don't see any issues even with multiple parallel connections.\nBut note that this is a shared blocking resource. Shared because we have just one connection across multiple application threads &amp; blocking because\non a single connection redis will block the next query until the previous one returns. Which means that this can have cascading effects.\nProblem\nLet's do some benchmarking with that single connection:\n\nAnd we are in for a surprise!\n\nWith 100 parallel queries, our result times jumped from 10ms to 1 second.\nThis is cascading effect and the load time of 1 second for redis is just plain bad.\nOf-course this is hypothetical, but note that I have considered RTT (round-trip time) for request 10ms\nconsidering local connection.

Here's a short story of how it went 🙂.\n\nThe code I was refactoring was large, but one repetition particularly stood out:\n\nThe UI had a large set of filters for filtering through a list - which is what this code does - filters through records from database.\nMy first thoughts were:\n\n\nWhy is this code so verbose?\n\n\nWhy do we need those if conditions? Without them, we can just chain those where clauses and this code would read so much better!\n\n\nLet us try removing the conditions. Ohh wait, this code does not have tests! 😱\nTime to flex rspec muscles 💪. Yeah TDD!\n\nRun tests - passes ✅\nRemove \"if\" - passes ✅ As expected.\nNow for the real test.. We naturally expect all records to be returned if no filter is applied.\n\nRun tests - passes ✅\nRemove \"if\" - fails ❌ There you go. That is why we need the condition.\nTo see what exactly is causing this: ** Hops into REPL **\n\nFair enough. ActiveRecord gets nil, it filters by NULL. Let us see if we can find a way to somehow still chain those methods.\nActiveRecord expects a Relation object for chaining to work. Try creating a generic method:\n\nThe secret sauce here is ActiveRecord's all method which returns scope (Relation) object of all queries applied until this point. And we know that if we have a Relation object, we can chain methods.\nRefactoring User.filter method:\n\nMuch better! 🎉\nTaking it a step further, the application had few more listing pages which means other models with similar .filter method. Our .where_if method is generic enough to be used by all of them.\n\nAnd now we can include Filterable in all those models having filter. I also went ahead and separated attribute and parameter which helps in cases where parameter name from frontend does not match the database attribute name in backend.\n","id":"https://tejasbubane.github.io/posts/2021-01-17-refactoring-filters/","title":"Refactoring Filters"},"https://tejasbubane.github.io/posts/2021-02-22-currying-reducers/":{"body":"Yesterday I was reading curried (partial) functions in Scala and I remembered the first time I used them in an actual production application.\n\nThis was with a ReactJS SPA which used Redux for managing state.\nNote: This blogpost assumes that the reader has basic understanding of Redux - namely defining and combining reducers.\nThe application I worked on was fetching data from backend APIs with paginated results and uniform response structure.\nFor example:\n\nFor which I wrote a reducer:\n\nBut this was just for one API. There were a few more:\n\n\nAs I wrote the second reducer for orders, I realized there was clearly a pattern here - a pattern that mirrored the backend API structure. But how do we harness this to create a good abstraction?\nIf we could pass another argument to the reducer functions - say type which is \"products\", \"orders\", etc. -\nthat would help us define different action-types for each API.\nBut the problem is those reducers are invoked by redux library.\nJavascript being dynamically typed will happily allow us to add a third parameter,\nbut its value would end up being undefined always because redux will not pass any value there.\nSo we cannot just add a third argument to every function. The function we provide to redux\nhas to match the function signature:\n\nI was studying functional programming back then with\nDan Grossman's fantastic course on Coursera which I highly recommend to any programmer -\nirrespective of the language you work with.\nFunctional programming invariably means functions as first-class citizens i.e. functions are\njust like any other values (integers, strings, etc.). Functions can be passed around as arguments and\nreturned as return-values from other functions. And redux being designed in a functional way helps us here.\n✨ Enter currying ✨\nCurrying is a technique which splits one function that takes multiple arguments into multiple functions\neach taking one or more arguments.\nIn our case, we can create a higher-order function that takes the listType argument, then builds and returns another function which matches the signature that redux expects.\n\nSee full code in this gist.\nHere's how we now use our listReducer:\n\nThese type of reducers are also sometimes called higher-order reducers -\nbecause they are higher-order functions.\nIf you found this interesting, also check out higher order components.\n","id":"https://tejasbubane.github.io/posts/2021-02-22-currying-reducers/","title":"Currying Reducers"},"https://tejasbubane.github.io/posts/2021-10-23-complete-testing-sidekiq/":{"body":"In this post we will see how to test async sidekiq jobs end-to-end.\n\nLet us take an example of a background worker for generating exports:\n\nThis is being called from controller:\n\nThis worker is doing quite a lot of things.

This is assuming that the job is idempotent (running it multiple times is not an issue).\nHowever allowing these jobs to fail, registers errors in monitoring tools like Sentry leading to error-rate spike alerts,\nincorrect metrics, etc. So we want to use Sidekiq's retries but exclude such errors from Sentry.\nWe can simply skip the error in Sidekiq configuration:\n\nMake sure to create a custom error.

Now we will see some other effective optimizations which can significantly improve our caching performance. This post focuses on API response caching with JSON, backed by Redis. But the ideas are generic and can be applied elsewhere as well.\nSplit cache\nWe want to achieve maximum cache hit ratio but have a large data to be cached. Some or the other entity within that JSON keeps updating and invalidating the cache. For example consider the following structure of cache:\n\ncheckout_page_cache\n\n\nWith this structure, cache will invalidate when any product within shopping cart, order status or user profile change. More invalidations means more cache miss and less performance.\nOn average, shopping cart changes way more often than user profile. If we split up the cache into separate parts, when shopping cart updates, we don't need to update user JSON. Not only does this increase cache hits, it also reduces DB queries for fetching related entities. So instead of single checkout_page_cache we have three separate ones:\n\nshopping_cart_cache\norders_cache\nusers_cache\n\nSeparate cache store\nApplications generally use Redis for multiple purposes apart from caching. eg. storing background jobs for sidekiq. Recommended configuration for cache store usually differs from these tools.\neg. Sidekiq recommends noeviction policy, whereas we should always have eviction policy for cache. Also having separate redis databases is better for separation of concerns and avoiding single point of failure.\nConfiguration\nAll cache keys should have an expiry. The redis instance should have maxmemory-policy (eviction policy) set so it doesn't run out of memory - you can find all supported eviction policies and their details here. It is also recommended to set read and write timeouts. More info on Redis cache configuration for Rails is available here.\nVersioning\nAdding versions helps ease cache schema changes.\neg: shopping cart cache:\n\nWe decide to store basic product (name and thumbnail) info to save DB queries:\n\nSuch a change will make cache inconsistent and will need workarounds in code to handle both cases (existing + new caches). Adding version helps with better handling and debugging which can be done in few different ways:\n1. Adding version to JSON body:\n\nClearly this is not the best way since it requires storing version at multiple places (especially in our example of arrays) and increases cache size.\n2. Using redis databases:\nIf our cache store is Redis, we can switch to a new DB when we change the schema. This has a drawback: we start fresh on new DB and our application will receive heavy cache miss and DB load for a brief period during transition.\n3. Adding version to cache key:\nWe can add version number to the cache key in addition to entity ID. eg. user_123_v1.

Let us explore the possibilities.\nThe Rails way\nSince the whitelist will be account-specific and optional, it will be stored in database. In Rails,\nthe first solution that comes to my mind is to use a before_action:\n\nThis is simple, elegant and works as per requirement - but has a downside of having to query the database on every request,\neven for invalid ones. For large-scale applications, it is not a good idea to add a global level query for every request.\nThe performance hits can be massive on the database, not to mention the slowdown in response times.\nCaching\nWe can fix this by caching the whitelisted IPs in redis/memcache.\n\nThis significantly reduces the overhead and is highly scalable.

We hash the API keys for more security when storing in cache.\nWe configure rack-attack to block requests if request IP does not exist in whitelist.\nFinally we can test this entire setup:\n\nSidenote: For plain rack apps without Rails, I found rack-test a nifty tool for testing.\nWas this rack solution a bit overkill?
