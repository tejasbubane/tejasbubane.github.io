first and longest read of 2025.\nI bought a kindle in June and started reading. Daily commutes helped get into the habit. First book I picked up was India after Gandhi by Ramchandra Guha.\nStarting with this huge 900+ pages book while getting into a reading habit after few years seems like a bad idea. But this book had been on the top of my TBR list for so long. And especially with all that is happening in the country today, I just had to read this.\nOne big lament I had with my school history curriculum is that - like cliche Indian movies it climaxed at Independence, switfly glanced over the formation of constitution saying: and they lived happily ever after...\nRamchandra Guha gives a brilliant potted history of India starting around 1947 all the way till 2017. This made me understand what a herculean task it was to unite, build and grow such a huge and varied mass of land. Partition, its aftermath, accession of princely states, building constitution, setting up electoral records and conducting elections, formation of states, regional conflicts in the north and north-east, foreign policies, wars, communal conflicts, industrialization, rise and fall of governments are few among a long list of events the country went through. The book seems to jump at many different geographical locations and places, but that is only because there was so much happening in the country and the writer tries to maintain chronological order of events.\nIt was fascinating to see traces of some current happenings back in time:\nThe negative side:\nWe always worship our great leaders, right since the first general election in 1951-52. After architecting the Indian constitution in 1950, B. R. Ambedkar chose to leave Congress and contest separately. Thanks to Nehru's aura, he lost to a milkman named Kajrolkar. P. K. Atre amusingly wrote in Marathi: कुठे तो घटनाकार आंबेडकर आणि कुठे हा लोणीविक्या कजरोळकर which rougly translates to: Where the great constitution maker Ambedkar and where this butter-seller Kajrolkar. We see many such occurrences today where capable and educated candidates lose by a landslide against incompetent ones.\nAfter the 1952 elections, someone remarked \"even a lamp-post standing on the Congress ticket could have been elected\".\nOne person becoming the embodiment of whole nation.\nThe 1975 emergency and re-election of same Prime Minister after just few years.\nPetty acts of vindictiveness and bans on a singer who refused to perform in a programme to raise money for the nation-wide family planning drive.\nWhen a prominent opposition leader organized a huge rally, to divert attention of the masses, famous movie Bobby was aired on national television at the exact same time.\nCongress was split into two parties Congress (O) and Congress (R). Maharashtra has seen similar breakups recently.\nYou can find many many such examples in the book. Perhaps these days things have gone too far and further amplified by social media, but the roots were already visible back in history.\nThe positive side:\nIndependence, Nehru's death, wars - after every major event, the west always proclaimed that country would fall apart. So many small princely states, religious hatred, nascant democracy of such huge scale, etc. were proving their point beyond doubt. And yet miraculously India stood strong on all those obstacles and grew.\nAnd as you can see even in this small blog, the negatives are piled up. But history echoes.\nThis is just a small glimpse, there is so much more in the book and I am so glad I read it.\nI understand India better now.","id":"https://tejasbubane.github.io/books/india-after-gandhi/","title":"India after Gandhi"},"https://tejasbubane.github.io/books/year-in-books-2025/":{"body":"I got back into a regular reading habit after few years. Here are the books I read:\n1. India after Gandhi\nAuthor: Ramchandra Guha ---- Goodreads\nMy best and longest read of 2025. I've written a separate blog about my reflections here.\n2. Brave new world\nAuthor: Aldous Huxley --- Goodreads\nDystopian fiction is one of my favourite genres thanks to Orwell. Here Huxley creates a distopian society with factories producing humans with precise qualities and intelligence for particular jobs, their emotions engineered since childhood, and adults consuming a drug called \"soma\" to suppress all emotions except happiness - so everybody is happy all the time - dystopia perceived as utopia.\nBut there is another world which is the opposite of this, and this story is about a man from that \"other\" world coming over into this one.\n3. Darkness at noon\nAuthor: Arthur Koestler --- Goodreads\nAjay Shah recommended this book in Everything is Everything podcast. The story behind this book is fascinating. Koestler was an ex-communist in his early days and later wrote about the horrors of communism in Soviet Russia. He wrote the original version in 1930s in German and his girlfriend loosely translated it into English. They lived in France and had to flee during war. Koestler sent his German copy to a publisher which got lost. The English version was published in 1940 and became a huge hit. So much that it is believed to have influenced 1946 France elections and the communist party lost. 80 years later the original German version was found in 2015 and we now have the properly translated version with its original essence preserved.\nThis book dives deep into the mind of a senior party leader Rubashov (fictional names for obvious reasons of those times) who turned from driven and faithful party leader to doubting party motives, and being eliminated for that. An absolute chilling portrayal of totalitarianism.\n4. The diary of a young girl\nAuthor: Anne Frank --- Goodreads\nAfter Darkness at noon, I wanted to read more world war books. Anne Frank is a young Jewish girl in Amsterdam who has to stay hiding in an attic for many months. We see war from the eyes of this young girl along with all her emotions, coming of age, relationships and family. This book is very raw which makes it extremely emotional and moving read.\n5. Ghachar Ghochar\nAuthor: Vivek Shanbhag --- Goodreads\nI was very sad after reading Diary of a young girl. I needed some light read so I picked up this book. It is about how an Indian family's fortune changes and how the family dynamics change along with that. It is a nicely written compact short read.\n6. My boyhood days\nAuthor: Rabindranath Tagore --- Goodreads\nBrowsing through the collected works of Rabindranath Tagore, I came across this story. This is Tagore reminscing over his boyhood days. It is a beautiful description of his home, trees and all the small joys of a child's life.\n7. Days at Morisaki bookshop\nAuthor: Satoshi Yagisawa --- Goodreads\nRecommended by my wife, I thought a light read of Japan would be calming for me - and it was. Set in Jimbocho, a locality of bookshops - this book will make you fall in love with books, coffee and Japan.\n8. And then there were none\nAuthor: Agatha Christie --- Goodreads\nThis was a monthly read by my local bookclub. I missed the meetup but had absolute fun reading this book. The plot - 10 strangers in a huge house on an island. I'm sure nobody could've seen the end coming - a perfect murder mystery - regarded as the best of Agatha Christie. I'm pretty sure I'm going to read more of her.\n9. Eleventh hour\nAuthor: Salman Rushdie --- Goodreads\nI came across this latest from Salman Rushdie somewhere on Goodreads and decided to give it a try. This was my first from Rushdie and it did not live upto expectations. It is a collection of short stories. It contains some great sentences and analogies, but except one (Musician of Kahani), I found the stories themselves very uneven. One story Oklahoma even mentions itself being uneven. I have mixed emotions because in some places I liked the writing. I will not let this deter me though. I have heard much about Rushdie and I'm looking forward to reading Midnight's children soon.\n10. I who have never known men\nAuthor: Jacqueline Harpman -- Goodreads\nAnother read from my local bookclub and for me another one influenced by world war. This Jewish author had to flee during world war and this book is clearly inspired by the Nazi concentration camps. A group of 40 women are kept in a bunker and nobody knows how or why they ended up there. They have vague memory of their past normal lives - except author who was a small girl when she ended up there and has no memory from the past - so in a way she is a bit different from the rest women. By accident they set free, again nobody knows why. Are they even on Earth or some other planet? This is a story of hope for these women in general and the girl in particular.\nThat's all.

Now we will see some other effective optimizations which can significantly improve our caching performance. This post focuses on API response caching with JSON, backed by Redis. But the ideas are generic and can be applied elsewhere as well.\nSplit cache\nWe want to achieve maximum cache hit ratio but have a large data to be cached. Some or the other entity within that JSON keeps updating and invalidating the cache. For example consider the following structure of cache:\ncheckout_page_cache\nWith this structure, cache will invalidate when any product within shopping cart, order status or user profile change. More invalidations means more cache miss and less performance.\nOn average, shopping cart changes way more often than user profile. If we split up the cache into separate parts, when shopping cart updates, we don't need to update user JSON. Not only does this increase cache hits, it also reduces DB queries for fetching related entities. So instead of single checkout_page_cache we have three separate ones:\nshopping_cart_cache\norders_cache\nusers_cache\nSeparate cache store\nApplications generally use Redis for multiple purposes apart from caching. eg. storing background jobs for sidekiq. Recommended configuration for cache store usually differs from these tools.\neg. Sidekiq recommends noeviction policy, whereas we should always have eviction policy for cache. Also having separate redis databases is better for separation of concerns and avoiding single point of failure.\nConfiguration\nAll cache keys should have an expiry. The redis instance should have maxmemory-policy (eviction policy) set so it doesn't run out of memory - you can find all supported eviction policies and their details here. It is also recommended to set read and write timeouts. More info on Redis cache configuration for Rails is available here.\nVersioning\nAdding versions helps ease cache schema changes.\neg: shopping cart cache:\nWe decide to store basic product (name and thumbnail) info to save DB queries:\nSuch a change will make cache inconsistent and will need workarounds in code to handle both cases (existing + new caches). Adding version helps with better handling and debugging which can be done in few different ways:\n1. Adding version to JSON body:\nClearly this is not the best way since it requires storing version at multiple places (especially in our example of arrays) and increases cache size.\n2. Using redis databases:\nIf our cache store is Redis, we can switch to a new DB when we change the schema. This has a drawback: we start fresh on new DB and our application will receive heavy cache miss and DB load for a brief period during transition.\n3.

We hash the API keys for more security when storing in cache.\nWe configure rack-attack to block requests if request IP does not exist in whitelist.\nFinally we can test this entire setup:\nSidenote: For plain rack apps without Rails, I found rack-test a nifty tool for testing.\nWas this rack solution a bit overkill?

It is amazing to see how these concepts transcend over programming paradigms, so let us explore it in an object oriented language.\nBasic objects\nFor starters we can match over basic data types like arrays and hashes:\n(I am using the rightward assignment =&gt; syntax in this blog post for brevity)\nAnd raises error when not matched:\nCustom objects\nThe interesting part comes when matching non-primitive objects.\nYou can use [] or () to match custom objects, extract and assign variables:\nLet us look at few more examples:\nPattern matching expects custom objects to define #deconstruct method. But why did it work with the Data objects above? Because Data class already has the method defined.\n#deconstruct is expected to return an array:\nHow about keyword arguments?\nWe don't necessarily have to use hash-style syntax in pattern matching just because the initializer accepts keyword arguments.\nNote the subtle difference in error message - while the array-style pattern matching expects #deconstruct method, the hash-style expects #deconstruct_keys method.\n#deconstruct_keys is expected to return a hash:\nYou must've noticed the keys argument to #deconstruct_keys. Hash patterns (unlike arrays) also match subhash:\nThe keys used in pattern are passed to #deconstruct_keys which are available to create the resulting hash.\nThis is useful when hash creation is expensive, we can calculate only the requested subhash.\nTesting\nMinitest offers assert_pattern and refute_pattern matchers for testing patterns which is especially useful for custom objects.\nPS: Pattern matching in Ruby is an evolving area. This blog post is based on the status of Ruby 3.4.2. Some things may change in future versions of Ruby.\nAll code from this blog post along with tests can be found in this executable gist.","id":"https://tejasbubane.github.io/posts/ruby-pattern-matching-custom-objects/","title":"Pattern matching on custom objects in Ruby"},"https://tejasbubane.github.io/posts/using-postgres-database-constraints-in-rails/":{"body":"Effective use of database constraints can ensure data integrity.\nIn an earlier blog post we used generated columns in PostgreSQL. In this one we will explore another cool database feature - constraints.\nMany times applications add some business constraints on our data.\neg.\nprice must be positive\ndiscount must be between 0 and 100\nproduct_sku must be 8 character long, etc.\nWe can encode these in Rails model validations:\nAbove single-column cases should generally work fine in most cases.\nBut let us consider a multi-column case where we want to ensure either the user_id or channel_id must be present:\nIn this case, multiple threads could try to remove one of those ids at the same time, each perfectly passing the Rails validation - and ending up with incorrect data.\nThis is where we need database constraints to ensure atomic consistency at the database level. We can use a CHECK constraint with any expression that evaluates to a boolean.\nFor above example, we need the num_nonnulls operator:\nadd_check_constraint was added in Rails 6.1, but you can use plain SQL migrations with earlier Rails versions. Make sure to name the constraint, otherwise database will generate a generic name like chk_rails_abcdef which is difficult to debug.\nWe can also compare two columns - and you can also add the constraint at the time of table creation:\nFailure of constraint raises ActiveRecord::StatementInvalid error, so you might need to handle that.\nAll code can be found in an executable format in this gist.
