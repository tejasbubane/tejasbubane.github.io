## Who are you, and what do you do?

I am a programmer with close to 7 years of experience. I build websites & APIs with Ruby on Rails & ReactJS during my dayjob. During my spare time, I play around with many programming languages like [Haskell](https://github.com/tejasbubane/haskell-book-code), [Clojure](https://github.com/tejasbubane/brave-clojure-book-code), [Elixir](https://github.com/tejasbubane/the-little-schmer-in-elixir), [ML](https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-languages/), etc. These days I am [playing with Rust](https://github.com/tejasbubane/adventofcode-2020/).

## What hardware do you use?

My primary computer at the moment is a Thinkpad E14. It is comparatively lightweight with a very comfortable keyboard.

I am not a heavy phone user - whatsapp & twitter are my primary apps. So I generally prefer mid-range android phones so I don't need to worry about damaging or losing it. I currently own a [Samsung M30](https://www.samsung.com/in/smartphones/galaxy-m30-m305f-3gb/SM-M305FMBEINS/).

Headphones are [Sennheiser CX 275 S](https://www.amazon.in/Sennheiser-CX-275-Universal-Headphone/dp/B008V6T1IW). I prefer in-ear since they are light & easy to carry around.

## And what software?

* [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) user since almost 8 years right from my college days - I am a huge fan. My emacs config is [here](https://github.com/tejasbubane/dotemacs).

* [Arch](https://www.archlinux.org/) - I switched to Arch (with [KDE](https://kde.org/)) a couple months back and loving it. Packages are latest - but so far I have not seen any breakages. Everything works quite well.

* Heavy user of [magit](https://magit.vc/) for all things git - this is hands-down `the best` git tool out there.

* I switched to [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/) as my primary browser after its [quantum release](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2017/11/14/introducing-firefox-quantum/) and never looked back.

* For terminal I use [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) using my [custom config](https://github.com/tejasbubane/dotfiles).

* For video calls I prefer [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) since it is comparatively less memory intensive.

## What would be your dream setup?

I find my current setup sufficient. My dream setup would be a nice 4k monitor with an ergonomic mechanical keyboard  like [ergodox](https://ergodox-ez.com/) or [atreus 2](https://atreus.technomancy.us/2). Someday...
