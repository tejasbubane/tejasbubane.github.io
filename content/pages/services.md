I have been building software and leading teams in fast-paced environments for over a decade. In the process I gained deep expertise in backend systems with Ruby on Rails, Postgresql and Elixir. Whether you're a startup looking to launch your first product or an established business seeking to modernize and scale, I am happy to help.

I can provide:

* Custom software development
* System architecture design / review
* Team augmentation
* Technical consultation
* Team re-alignment
* Mentoring
* Debugging critical bugs and performance issues

and much more...
