## Who are you, and what do you do?

I am a programmer with 10+ years of experience. I build websites & APIs with Ruby on Rails & ReactJS during my dayjob. During my spare time, I play around with many programming languages like [Haskell](https://github.com/tejasbubane/haskell-book-code), [Clojure](https://github.com/tejasbubane/brave-clojure-book-code), [Rust](https://github.com/tejasbubane/adventofcode-2020/), [ML](https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-languages/), etc. These days I am [playing with Elixir](https://github.com/tejasbubane/adventofcode-2021/).

## What hardware do you use?

I am a fan of Thinkpads and Linux so currently using [Thinkpad E14](https://www.lenovo.com/in/en/laptops/thinkpad/thinkpad-e-series/E14/p/22TPE14E4N1) with [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/) as my primary driver. It is comparatively lightweight and has probably the best laptop keyboard ever - the tactile feel and keytravel is unmatched.

I am not a heavy phone user - whatsapp & twitter are my primary apps. I generally prefer mid-range android phones so I don't need to worry about damaging or losing it. I currently own a [Samsung A14](https://www.samsung.com/in/smartphones/galaxy-a/galaxy-a14-5g-black-64gb-sm-a146bzkdins/)

Monitor is [Dell P2419H](https://www1.ap.dell.com/content/products/productdetails.aspx/dell-p2419h-monitor). It is height adjustable, can be rotated to vertical and has handy 4 USB ports.

I work remotely so video calls are an integral part of my setup. I use the [Lenovo 300 FHD webcam](https://www.lenovo.com/in/en/accessories-and-monitors/webcams-and-video/webcams/NET-BO-300-FHD-Webcam/p/GXC1B34793) which I must say is pretty good for the price.

## And what software?

* [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) user right from my college days. The high customizability and light-weight snappy experience has made me a huge fan of emacs and I don't think I will switch to any other editor anytime soon. My [emacs config](https://github.com/tejasbubane/dotemacs) has also evolved over many years.

* [Arch](https://www.archlinux.org/) - I switched to Arch with [KDE Plasma](https://kde.org/plasma-desktop/) a couple months back and loving it. Packages are latest and so far I have not seen any breakages. Everything works quite well.

* Heavy user of [magit](https://magit.vc/) for all things git - this is hands-down `the best` git tool out there.

* I switched to [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/) as my primary browser after its [quantum release](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2017/11/14/introducing-firefox-quantum/) and never looked back.

* For terminal, I use [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) using my [custom config](https://github.com/tejasbubane/dotfiles).

* For video calls, I prefer [Zoom](https://zoom.us/).

## What would be your dream setup?

I find my current setup sufficient. My dream setup would be a nice 4k monitor with an ergonomic mechanical keyboard  like [ergodox](https://ergodox-ez.com/) or [atreus 2](https://atreus.technomancy.us/2). Someday...
