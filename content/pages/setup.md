## Who are you, and what do you do?

I have been working as a programmer for over a decade. I work primarily with [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) and [ReactJS](https://react.dev/) during my dayjob. In my spare time, I play around with many programming languages like [Haskell](https://github.com/tejasbubane/haskell-book-code), [Clojure](https://github.com/tejasbubane/brave-clojure-book-code), [Rust](https://github.com/tejasbubane/adventofcode-2020/), [ML](https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-languages/), etc. These days I am [playing with Elixir](https://github.com/tejasbubane/exercism_submissions/tree/master/elixir).

## What hardware do you use?

I am currently using [Macbook Air M4](https://theapplewiki.com/wiki/MacBook_Air_(13-inch,_M4,_2025)) as my primary driver. I love the hardware, it is extremely lightweight, quite powerful machine with long-lasting battery.

I am not a heavy phone user - apart from calls, whatsapp & twitter are my primary apps. I generally prefer mid-range phones so I don't need to worry about damaging or losing it. But recently after loving the Macbook, I gave in to the temptation and got an [iPhone 15 Plus](https://theapplewiki.com/wiki/IPhone_15_Plus). I wanted the large screen without spending a lot.

## And what software?

* [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) user right from my college days. The high customizability and light-weight snappy experience has made me a huge fan of emacs and I don't think I will switch to any other editor anytime soon. My [emacs config](https://github.com/tejasbubane/dotemacs) has also evolved over many years.

* Heavy user of [magit](https://magit.vc/) for all things git - this is hands-down `the best` git interface out there.

* I switched to [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/) as my primary browser after its [quantum release](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2017/11/14/introducing-firefox-quantum/) and never looked back.

* For terminal, I use [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) using my [custom config](https://github.com/tejasbubane/dotfiles).

* For video calls, I prefer [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) for the amazing inbuilt noise cancellation.

## What would be your dream setup?

I find my current setup sufficient. My dream setup would be a nice 4k monitor with an ergonomic mechanical keyboard  like [ergodox](https://ergodox-ez.com/) or [atreus 2](https://atreus.technomancy.us/2). Someday...
